## Projects Done

### **Project 1: Banking Application**
This project demonstrates the complete infrastructure setup and deployment of a scalable Bank Application using a three-tier architecture on AWS.  
It includes the provisioning of all resources using Terraform, container orchestration with Amazon EKS (Kubernetes), GitOps deployment using ArgoCD, and a secure CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions via a self-hosted Docker-based runner.

- Automated provisioning on AWS & Azure using Terraform (IaC) with reusable modules.
- CI/CD & Deployment using GitHub Actions & ArgoCD ‚Äî improved rollout speed by **45%**.

## üîê Cybersecurity in the Cloud (with Hardening of Base Image using STIG)

Security is not an afterthought ‚Äî it‚Äôs embedded in every stage of my work.  
I leverage **Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)** standards to harden base images before deployment, ensuring all systems meet strict compliance and security benchmarks.

Key practices include:
- Applying STIG-compliant configurations to operating system images.
- Enforcing least-privilege access through AWS IAM best practices.
- Implementing automated vulnerability scanning and patch management.
- Monitoring security metrics with CloudWatch, Datadog, and GuardDuty.

This proactive approach reduces vulnerabilities and strengthens cloud workloads against evolving threats.
